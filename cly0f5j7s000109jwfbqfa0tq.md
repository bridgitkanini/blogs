Hey there fellow developers and tech enthusiasts! Today, I want to take you on a journey through a recent challenge I faced as a budding backend developer and why I’m excited to embark on the HNG Internship program.

### **The Struggle is Real: Taming Strapi in a React Vite App**

Imagine this: you’re building an e-commerce app, everything is going smoothly on the frontend with React and Vite, but then comes the backend management monster—Strapi. It’s like introducing a T. Rex to a tea party! Integrating Strapi into my React Vite app was my latest uphill battle in the vast world of backend development.

#### **Step-by-Step Breakdown of Conquering Strapi Integration**

1. **The Encounter**: Strapi is powerful, but its setup can be daunting, especially when you're juggling it with a slick frontend setup like React Vite. It felt like trying to teach a cat to fetch—challenging but potentially rewarding.
    
2. **The Learning Curve**: My first step was diving into YouTube tutorials. There’s nothing like watching someone else wrestle with the same beast to make you feel less alone! Armed with newfound knowledge, I plunged into the Strapi documentation, navigating through endpoints and content types like a digital archaeologist.
    
3. **Pair Programming**: Feeling a bit like a lone cowboy, I roped in my tech-savvy peers for some good old-fashioned pair programming. Two heads are better than one, right? Together, we tamed Strapi’s wild side, figuring out how to fetch data from the backend into our React Vite frontend seamlessly.
    
4. **Exploring Alternatives**: Along the way, I stumbled upon other backend integration gems like ExpressJS and MongoDB. It was like discovering secret passages in a labyrinth—each route offering its own set of challenges and rewards.
    

### **Why HNG Internship?**

Now, you might wonder, why am I eager to dive into the HNG Internship program? Well, grab your popcorn because here’s the scoop:

#### **Curiosity and Growth**

Since I first heard about frontend vs. backend developers, I’ve been fascinated by the backend’s mysterious allure. APIs? They’re like the Goliath to my David—a challenge waiting to be conquered. HNG Internship isn’t just a stone in my hand; it’s the slingshot I need to take down that giant!

#### **Mastering MERN and Beyond**

I’m not just here, in the tech space, for the frontend. I want to master the MERN stack—MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, and Node.js—inside and out. Python? Bring it on! It' the most popular backend web technology and I can't wait to get into it. In my research on backend development technologies, I’ve also come across terms such as MySQL, NoSQL, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, and I keep wondering, what’s up with all these SQL’s?

I'm also lowkey wondering if I'll get to write code in zero's and ones. Sounds pretty cool right? Maybe even look as genius as those programmers in the movies generating thousands of lines of code by the second, defeating the bad guys and saving the world!

Whatever backend technologies the internship has to offer, I am more than ready to tackle them head on. HNG Internship promises to deepen my backend expertise, transforming me into a versatile developer ready to tackle any project that comes my way.

### **Join Me on This Adventure**

So, fellow developers, whether you’re a frontend aficionado or a backend guru-in-training, remember this: every challenge is an opportunity to level up. With a bit of humour, a dash of perseverance, and the right internship, we can all conquer our digital Goliaths.
