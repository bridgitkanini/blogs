**This one time in an interview, I confused the Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) with Data Object Modification.**

I could tell I’d made that blunder the moment the words left my mouth. My brain went, “Well, that’s not right,” and the interviewer just nodded politely. Thankfully, they weren’t harsh — and honestly, many tech interviewers aren’t. They’re usually more interested in how you think through a problem, not whether you’ve memorized textbook definitions.

At least I got the Object part right, lol.

Still… I wish I’d known what to expect.

If you're anything like me — self-taught, bootcamp-trained, or even someone who’s been building things in React but hasn’t faced many interviews — you’ve probably had this same question:

**“Where do I even start preparing for a React interview?”**

This article is both my answer and my preparation journal. A guide I wish I had before walking into that interview. A collection of buzzwords I’ve heard in interviews, tech talks, webinars, and mock interview prep sessions.

And yes — everyone keeps saying this, and it’s true:

> **Reading the official** [**React Docs**](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react) **is interview prep 101.**  
> Don’t skip it.

So here we go — buzzwords, broken down.

---

## Buzzwords and What They Actually Mean

### 1\. **Virtual DOM**

The Virtual DOM (**Document Object Model**) is like a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. React uses it to figure out what changed and updates only that part of the real DOM — for performance.

**Interview angle:**  
They might ask, ‘What is the Virtual DOM, and why is it important in React?’ or quiz you indirectly via performance-related questions.

**Tip:** Practice explaining how React decides *what to update* and *why that's efficient*.

**How React decides what to update (and why it's efficient):**

1. **Creates a new virtual DOM tree** based on the updated state.
    
2. **Compares** it with the previous virtual DOM
    
3. **Finds the differences (or “diffs”)** between the old and new trees.
    
4. **Updates only the changed parts** of the actual DOM — not the entire page.
    

This makes React efficient because:

* DOM updates are slow and costly for the browser, but virtual DOM comparisons are fast.
    
* By batching and minimizing updates, React keeps your app snappy and responsive.
    

**Bonus analogy:**  
Think of React as a smart editor. Instead of retyping the whole document, it just highlights and rewrites the changed words.

---

### **2\. JSX**

JSX is a syntax extension that lets you write HTML-like code in JavaScript files. It looks like HTML, but it’s not.

**Interview angle:**

> “What is JSX? Can React work without it?”

**Tip:**  
JSX doesn’t add new functionality to React — it just makes your code more readable. Under the hood, JSX is transformed into `React.createElement()` calls. For example:

```javascript
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

becomes:

```javascript
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, world!');
```

So yes, React works without JSX — it’s just less convenient. JSX is a friendlier way to describe UI in code, not a separate language or required feature.

---

### **3\. Hooks**

Hooks are special functions in React that let you **use state and lifecycle behavior** inside functional components — without needing class components.

**Why were hooks introduced?**  
Before Hooks, if you wanted to manage state or use lifecycle methods (`componentDidMount`, etc.), you had to write class components — which were more complex and harder to reuse logic across components.

Hooks solved that by:

* Making code **simpler** and **easier to share**
    
* Enabling **logic reuse** through **custom hooks**
    
* Letting all components be written as **functions**
    

**Common Hooks:**

* `useState` – Add local state
    
* `useEffect` – Run side effects
    
* `useRef` – Reference a DOM element or persist a value across renders
    
* `useMemo` – Cache expensive values
    
* `useCallback` – Cache functions to avoid unnecessary re-renders
    

**useMemo vs. useCallback?**

* `useMemo(fn, deps)` → Caches a **value** returned by `fn`
    
* `useCallback(fn, deps)` → Caches the **function** itself
    

Both help with **performance optimization** — especially in large or deeply nested components.

**Interview angle:**  
“Why were hooks introduced? What’s the difference between useMemo and useCallback?”

**Tip:** Learn by building a small custom hook. It’s the best way to understand the ‘why.’

---

### **4\. useState**

`useState` is a Hook that lets functional components hold and update state (aka memory). Before Hooks, only class components could do this.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

* `count`: current state value
    
* `setCount`: function to update it
    
* `0`: initial value
    

Every time `setCount` is called, React **re-renders** the component with the new value.

**Example use cases:**

* Toggling a modal:
    
    ```javascript
    const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
    setIsOpen(prev => !prev); // toggles between true/false
    ```
    
* Tracking input fields, dark mode, score, etc.
    

**Why it matters:**  
State changes trigger automatic UI updates — no need to touch the DOM manually. React does it for you.

**Interview angle:**  
Expect practical questions — “How would you toggle a boolean with useState?”

**Tip:** Understand how updating state re-renders a component and triggers changes in the UI.

---

### **5\. useEffect**

`useEffect` is a React Hook that lets your component **do things after it renders** — like fetching data, listening to events, or starting a timer. These are called **side effects** because they affect things outside the component.

**Example:**

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
}, []);
```

* Runs after the component is shown on the screen.
    
* `[]` means “only run this once” — like `componentDidMount`.
    

**Dependency Array — What’s that?**

The second argument (the square brackets) controls **when** the effect runs:

* `[]`: Run once.
    
* `[value]`: Run when `value` changes.
    
* Omit it: Runs after **every** render (usually not ideal).
    

**Cleanup:**

Some effects need to **clean up** after themselves — like stopping a timer or unsubscribing.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const id = setInterval(() => console.log('tick'), 1000);
  return () => clearInterval(id);
}, []);
```

That `return` function runs when the component is removed or re-runs the effect — preventing bugs or memory leaks.

**Tip:**  
Be ready to explain **what triggers the effect**, and why **cleanup** helps keep your app smooth and bug-free.

---

### **6\. Props vs State**

At the heart of React components are two ways to handle data: **props** and **state**. They both store data, but they do it differently and for different reasons.

### **Props (short for “properties”)**

Props are like arguments you pass into a function. They come **from outside** the component — usually from a parent component — and they are **read-only**. You can't change them inside the component that receives them.

Think of props like a lunchbox your parent hands you every morning. You didn’t pack it yourself, and you’re not supposed to change what’s inside — you just eat what you're given.

**Example:**  
Let’s say we have a `Button` component that needs to display a label:

```javascript
function Button(props) {
  return <button>{props.label}</button>;
}

// Usage
<Button label="Submit" />
```

Here, `"Submit"` is passed as a prop. The `Button` just displays whatever label it receives — it doesn't care where it came from or why.

---

### **State**

State is **internal** to a component. It’s like the component’s brain — it remembers things and can change over time, often in response to user input or other events. Unlike props, state **can be updated** using React’s `useState()` hook (in function components).

Think of state like your own mood. No one hands it to you — you feel it yourself, and it can change depending on what happens during the day.

**Example:**  
Say you’re building a simple form with an input field that updates as the user types:

```javascript
function Form() {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');

  function handleChange(event) {
    setInputValue(event.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <input
      type="text"
      value={inputValue}
      onChange={handleChange}
    />
  );
}
```

Here, `inputValue` is **state**. It belongs to the `Form` component, and it updates every time the user types something. This is something that wouldn’t make sense to manage with props — it’s not coming from a parent, it’s *happening inside* this component.

---

**Interview Angle:**

* *“What’s the difference between props and state?”*  
    Props are **passed in** and **read-only**.  
    State is **managed internally** and **can change**.
    
* *“When would you use one over the other?”*  
    Use **props** to configure or customize components from the outside (e.g., button labels, colors, sizes).  
    Use **state** to keep track of things that change while the component is in use (e.g., input values, toggles, counters, whether a dropdown is open).
    

---

### **7\. Component Lifecycle**

Every React component goes through a lifecycle: **mounting**, **updating**, and **unmounting**.

* In **class components**, lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` handle side effects and cleanup.
    
* In **functional components**, we use the `useEffect` Hook to simulate this behavior.
    

**Example:**

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // runs on mount
  console.log("Component mounted");

  return () => {
    // runs on unmount
    console.log("Component unmounted");
  };
}, []);
```

The empty dependency array `[]` ensures the effect runs only once — like `componentDidMount`. The return function handles cleanup — like `componentWillUnmount`.

---

**Interview angle:**  
*"Where would you clean up event listeners or cancel timers?"*  
→ Inside the `return` function of `useEffect`.

**Tip:** Understand **when** `useEffect` runs (after paint), and how it differs based on the dependencies passed in.8.

---

### **8\. Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components**

Controlled components are form inputs where React state controls the value. Every change updates state, and the displayed value comes directly from React.

Example:

```javascript
const [name, setName] = useState('');
<input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />
```

Uncontrolled components let the DOM manage the input’s value internally. You access the current value using refs when needed, not on every change.

Example:

```javascript
const inputRef = useRef();
<input ref={inputRef} />
// Later, get value with inputRef.current.value
```

**When to use uncontrolled?**

* When you want simple forms without continuous React updates — for example, a contact form where you only read values on submit instead of every keystroke.
    
* For quick prototypes or integrating non-React code — like wrapping a third-party widget or legacy form that manages its own state.
    
* When performance is critical and you want fewer renders — large forms with many inputs benefit by reducing React state updates.
    
* When working with inputs like file selectors where syncing with React state is tricky or unnecessary.
    

**Interview angle:**  
Be ready to explain the difference and when uncontrolled inputs might be appropriate despite controlled being the norm.

**Tip:** Controlled inputs are preferred for predictability, validation, and easier state management in most React apps.

---

### **9\. Lifting State Up**

When two sibling components need to share state, you move it up to their common parent. This way, the shared state lives in one place and flows down as props.

**Example:** Syncing input and display between siblings

```javascript
function Parent() {
  const [text, setText] = useState('');

  return (
    <>
      <InputComponent text={text} onTextChange={setText} />
      <DisplayComponent text={text} />
    </>
  );
}

function InputComponent({ text, onTextChange }) {
  return (
    <input 
      value={text} 
      onChange={e => onTextChange(e.target.value)} 
      placeholder="Type something..."
    />
  );
}

function DisplayComponent({ text }) {
  return <p>You typed: {text}</p>;
}
```

**Interview angle:**  
“How would you sync form input and display logic between components?”

**Tip:** Draw the component tree — it helps you visualize where the state lives and how data flows.

```javascript
Parent
 ├── InputComponent (receives `text` and `onTextChange` as props)
 └── DisplayComponent (receives `text` as a prop)
```

---

### 10\. Reconciliation

Reconciliation is React’s process for **comparing the previous Virtual DOM with the new one** after a state or prop change. Instead of re-rendering the entire UI, React calculates the minimal set of changes needed and updates only those parts in the real DOM — making rendering efficient and fast.

**How it works:**

* React creates a Virtual DOM tree.
    
* When state/props change, it creates a new Virtual DOM.
    
* React **diffs** the old and new trees to find differences.
    
* Only changed elements are updated in the real DOM.
    

**Example:**

When rendering lists, React uses `key` props to identify which items changed, were added, or removed.

```javascript
{items.map(item => (
  <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
))}
```

Without stable keys, React can’t properly track elements, causing unnecessary re-renders or bugs.

**Interview angle:**  
Be ready to explain how React’s reconciliation optimizes performance, like, why using keys in lists is crucial for this process.

---

### 11\. Code Splitting

**What it is:** Splitting your app’s code into smaller chunks that load on demand, improving initial load time and performance.

**Common tools:**

* `dynamic import()` for lazy-loading modules
    
* React’s `lazy()` + `Suspense` for lazy-loading components
    

**Example:**

```javascript
import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';

const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <LazyComponent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

**Interview angle:**  
*“How to improve React app performance?”* — mention code splitting and bundlers like Webpack or Vite that automate chunking.

---

### 12\. **UI Component Libraries vs Custom Components**

**UI Libraries:** Pre-built, styled, and accessible components (e.g., MUI, Chakra UI, Shadcn, Daisy UI, Recharts). They speed up development but may limit customization.

**Custom Components:** Built from scratch for full control over design, behavior, and branding, but take more time.

**Interview angle:**  
“Have you used UI libraries? When build custom?”

**Tip:**  
Discuss trade-offs:

* Libraries = faster dev, consistent UI, built-in accessibility
    
* Custom = tailored design, unique branding, full control
